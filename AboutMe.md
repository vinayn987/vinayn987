- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @VinayN
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m happy to contribute to the _Open source softwares_
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **DSA, Java, Python**


 I am persuing BCA in BNU, currently I am 3rd year BCA student. I learnt some technologies like **C, C#.NET, DBMS, SQL, OS**
 I love to code and learning new things, I came this field with biology background but I never feel bad for my decision this best decision I ever took in my 
 life. These skills are very innovative and need so much attention to learn, when I am exploring new things in the tech 
 fortunately we got OSS topic in 4th semester then I know about **Git, GitHub, BitBucket, BugTrac, Apache, BSD** and I feel very uncomfortable because there are so many things 
 to explore in the world but I am procastinating about my academics then I was decided to contribute in OSS but I don't how to do it I watch so many tutorials but not effective 
 still I need to learn so many things in this GitHub Platform 

 My motivation is "_Always feel free to make mistakes and never forgot to learn from it_"

 Thank you for reading aboutme
